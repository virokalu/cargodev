// Shared VehicleDocumentType display metadata — one source of truth for the
// labels/accepted-file-types shown next to each typed document section
// (Add/Edit form's Files panel, the read-only detail page). OTHER is the
// pre-existing generic "Add Documents" bucket, kept for anything that
// doesn't fit the named types below.
//
// `accept` is a comma-separated MIME list, same format the HTML file input
// and FileDropZone already expect. Every type is PDF-only except
// PURCHASE_INVOICE and CASH_RECEIPT, which also take a photo (a scanned
// invoice or a picture of a physical receipt) — the matching server-side
// rule lives in lib/validation/upload.schema.ts, kept in sync manually
// since one is a client constant and the other a zod schema and there's no
// good way to share a literal between them across the client/server
// boundary here.
